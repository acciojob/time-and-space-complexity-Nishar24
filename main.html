	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of computational time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize time complexity to ensure quick execution, especially for large datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute relative to its input size. It is often expressed in terms of O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. Optimizing space complexity is crucial for applications with limited memory resources.
